            Description: Ryu wears a white gi, as a symbol of his Japanese
            heritage, with the Japanese symbols for the Fūrinkazan (風林火山
            (Hepburn: "Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain")) on his belt as well as a
            stylised version on his gloves. Karate gloves, also known as karate
            sparring gloves or mitts, are protective gear worn by martial
            artists during karate sparring or training sessions. These gloves
            are designed to provide some degree of protection to the hands and
            knuckles while allowing the martial artist to maintain mobility and
            dexterity.

            Description: Hand-fighting weapons are small, portable weapons,
            often worn covertly, and usually intended to wound or maim rather
            than kill. One such weapon, designed for concealment, was the bagh
            nakh or 'Tiger's Claw'. It was worn under a glove or between the
            fingers to give the wearer the advantage of surprise in duels and
            street fights.

            Description: Masks (máscaras) have been used dating back to the
            beginnings of Lucha Libre in the early part of the 20th century, and
            have a historical significance to Mexico in general, dating to the
            days of the Aztecs. Early masks were very simple with basic colors
            to distinguish the wrestler.

            Description: According to Akiman, the team incorporated Koppōjutsu
            into Ibuki's ninjutsu-based moveset because the fighting style was
            gaining popularity around the time she was being designed. A kunai
            is a traditional Japanese tool that has a long history of use, both
            as a farming implement and as a concealed weapon. It is often
            described as a type of knife or dagger and is characterized by its
            simple design, which consists of a straight, pointed blade with a
            handle at the opposite end.

            sports practitioners to protect their hands during training,
            sparring, and competitive matches. They serve several important
            functions, including hand protection, wrist support, and enhancing
            the safety of both the user and their sparring partner.

            Description: The drink in Jamie's jug is called Yakutou (薬湯), an
            herbal tea instead of alcohol. Matsumoto followed up by calling it
            "a special drink" and everyone in the room started laughing. Drunk
            style martial arts, also known as Drunken Fist or Zui Quan (醉拳) in
            Chinese, is a unique and theatrical martial arts style that imitates
            the movements and behavior of a drunken person. It is characterized
            by its fluid, unpredictable, and erratic movements that make it
            appear as though the practitioner is stumbling or swaying like
            someone who has consumed alcohol.
